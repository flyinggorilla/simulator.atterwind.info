# Apparent wind simulator for sailtwist analysis
This simulation visualizes wind sheer and how it influences apparent wind at various boat headings. Understanding apparent wind directions at top, mid and lower parts of sail is helpful learning sail-trim.

TODO:
* vizualize sail, and add "angle of attack" 
* allow adjusting wind-sheer to stable or gusty wind-conditions
